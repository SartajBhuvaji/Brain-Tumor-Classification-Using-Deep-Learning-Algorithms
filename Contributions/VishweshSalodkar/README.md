# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## Overview

This is a Kaggle notebook for brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The notebook was created by [Vishwesh Salodkar](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vishweshsalodkar).

## Description

In this notebook, we tackle the task of brain tumor detection in medical images using CNNs. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify brain MRI images.

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Exploring the dataset and loading the brain MRI images for training and testing.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the images, such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

3. Model Architecture: Defining the CNN architecture for brain tumor classification.

4. Model Training: Training the CNN model on the preprocessed data.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.

6. Results and Visualization: Visualizing the model's predictions and performance metrics.

## How to Use the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook directly from Kaggle.

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. The notebook might require common libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

3. Make sure you have the brain tumor dataset available. You can find the dataset link in the notebook or provide your own dataset following the same format.

4. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell and run the model.
